I have implemented the OnlineShop project using clean architecture webapi, and I am happy to share that I have created a Global middleware for error handling all services. Additionally, I have created a Custom ActionResult for Return Data and messages, and I have called parameters from appsettings.json for instance DBConnection. Finally, I used Microsoft.Extensions.Logging and wrote LogInformation in file.txt.
